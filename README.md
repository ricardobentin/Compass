**MVP**

1. Who is your target audience?  People looking to find new ways of discovering content, and people looking for a way to discuss or even enjoy (via fandango or seat geek) an event together

2. What is the problem that the product will address? It is increasingly difficult for someone to find content that they like because there is so much content out there. People are looking for a recommendation from an algorithm (if you like x you may also like y), friends or peers (social network component), lists (academy award winning movies, emmy award winning shows, pulitzer prize winning novels, grammy award winning artists, etc), or by going and experiencing something new together (going to see a movie or a concert)

3. What is the primary goal of the product? Goal is to allow users to discover content in new and traditional ways, leverage their social network for discussion and recommendations on content, and enabled users to go and experience a movie or live-event together through the platform

4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?

    1. User setup - Present the user with various entertainment categories to build their profile and from there use the profile as a base for recommendations. Once user setup is complete - recommendations start coming in from rovicorp API, however the user can also look for recommendations based on their social network (not FB or IG but the network inside the platform)
     - from rovi api, pull all available mega entertainment categories (movies, music, books, etc.)
     - allow users to drill down into those categories to give you specific movies, books, artists, etc.

    2.  Build social network so that if you have common interests to your friend's, there will be some signal that this is the case

    3.  Leverage Fandango and Seat Geek to see if there are any live events bases on the users interests or recommendations that would make sense to present
